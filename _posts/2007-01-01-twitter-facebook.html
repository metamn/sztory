    With social networks living inside mobile applications we could stop here in telling the story of the web.

  <p>
    <q>'After a short period, at the beginning of the Internet of Things, the web was replaced with native applications running on various devices'</q> we could probably say in another timeline, "The History of Internet".

    Fact is this combo&mdash;native apps and ubiquoitous networks&mdash; changed definitively the web landscape.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What started initially by Wordpress and Web 2.0 as a large scale, open participation and syndication of user generated content&mdash;in a few years defaced the web. Today what matters for the majority of internauts is the stream hitting constantly their devices. And this has nothing to do with the web, it's the opposite.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web was built on openness while all social networks are closed: login for access. The web was built on clicks while the networks are a pull to refresh. The web meant active discovery the networks are guarded by app stores. The web has universal standards and open decision making&mdash;HTML, CSS, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)&mdash;when networks are controlled exclusivley by private companies. On the web self-privacy was natural when in networks is inexistent. On the web you were a product for Google and Yahoo now on networks you are even for your weather app.

  <p>
    Due to human nature this won't change. Apps will always dominate the stream, the surface of the digital universe. What is beyond&mdash;a step back and a closer look&mdash;will stay in the realm of the web and now partners-in-history, the books and printed magazines.
