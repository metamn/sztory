  <h3>World Wild Web</h3>
  
  <p>
    Unlike Eric Mayer "The King of CSS", Jakob Nielsen a Danish researcher later coined as "The King of Usability" has a very public so {% include atoms/link.html url="http://www.dourish.com/nielsen.html" title="Hacking Jakob Nielsen" text="controversial" %} profile.

    While other pioneers were working on the web infrastructure&mdash;the browser, structuring (HTML) and styling (CSS) content&mdash; Nielsen started to think with the readers and users mind.

  <p>
    In the first years the World Wild Web looks funny; there were no web designers, web developers, user experience engineers but sysadmins and webmasters. Mostly with Computer Science background these gatekeepers of the web often came up with ... strange visual solutions.

    In this scene appears a young scientist fluent in Human-Computer Interactions with strong support from an IT giant, Sun Microsystems.

    Nielsen started to research what makes websites work, how to deliver the message in this shiny new medium. He was not focused on graphic design&mdash;typography, layout, colors, icons, etc.&mdash; but influencing visistor's behaviour in such way to achieve a goal like clicking a button which, for example, has the 'Purchase' text on it.

    Many of his results are de-facto standard in today's web user interface design: {% include atoms/link.html url="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/" title="F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content" text="F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content" %}, {% include atoms/link.html url="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/113-design-guidelines-homepage-usability/" title="Design Guidelines for Homepage Usability" text="Design Guidelines for Homepage Usability" %} and {% include atoms/link.html url="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" title="10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" text="10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" %}.

    He concludes <q>visitors can focus only on five things on a single page</q> and identifies these focus points with their function:
  </p>
  
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2">focus point</th>
        <th>function</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>identity</td>
        <td>makes the visitor feeling safe, being in the right place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>offer</td>
        <td>what this page offers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>values</td>
        <td>emphasize what your site does that's valuable from the user's point of view, as well as how you differ from key competitors.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>action</td>
        <td>emphasize the highest priority tasks so that users have a clear starting point for what to do next.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>entertainment</td>
        <td>if all above are not interesting for the user make it feel good by offering something fun which still connects / links back to your site.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

    Well designed pages today follows exactly these rules. You don't have to wonder why sometimes you are getting excited to add things in your shopping cart.
