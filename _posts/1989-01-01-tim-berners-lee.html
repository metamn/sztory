  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via {% include atoms/link.html url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System" text="Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)" %}, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with {% include atoms/link.html url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet" text="Usenet" %}, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web breakthrough with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The 'dumb' terminal browser made room for graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. Visual web content editors enabled non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure it will stay open.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.
