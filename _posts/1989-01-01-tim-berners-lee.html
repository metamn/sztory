  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via {% include atoms/link.html url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System" text="Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)" %}, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with {% include atoms/link.html url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet" text="Usenet" %}, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rapidly the 'dumb' terminal browser was replaced with graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) web content editors were created to enable non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure their founding principles of openness are kept.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.
