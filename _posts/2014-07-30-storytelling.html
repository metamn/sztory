    In the last seven years of mobile apps and networks, multi-billion dollar acquisitions in this market coming out from nowhere, international privacy scandals, and with the Internet of Things on radar the picture is clear. The web will stay as a second class citizen, as a set of interconnected and open websites with high quality content, when first class will be taken by signals collected into ubiquoutos and uniform streams from everything and everybody on Earth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a little bit eliberating for creatives and thinkers. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As taking a book or a magazine for relaxation, entertainment and deep learning&mdash;the web will become the same companion. Daytime we will be guided by the living things around and we will flow with the stream. When looking for something outstanding, or want to produce something interesting we will use the web.

    It's no surprise New York Times 'invented' storytelling. They've learnt how to survive the print-to-digital metasystem transformation with a paywall and better content.

    The good news for the web is that matured to a level to rival television. With motion picture embedded in recent websites, the full typographic arsenal domesticated from the print industry, games running in the browser&mdash;the web mixed up what was best in old mediums, and, by it's nature, made it open and available to large communities to assure it's own evolution.

    The web is dead, long live the web.
