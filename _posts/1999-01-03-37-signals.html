  <h3>The company</h3>
  
  <p>
    The Chicago&mdash;more precisely&mdash;worldwide based, quasi officeless company 37Signals is pretty unique on the web palette. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's a modern hybrid influencing the web in various ways. Maybe their biggest impact was demystifying business and make web people entrepreneurs, but also their contribution to decompose technology in smaller stacks will be probably a historical move.

  <h3>The idols</h3>
  
  <p>
    The company was founded by Jason Fried, a web designer who realized building web applications instead of web sites is a viable business. His company's thinking and work  disrupted the entire establishment introducing new concepts like self-founding startups, software as a service, simple and small means power.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Together with partner and rockstar developer David Heinemeier Hansson they've brought modernism to web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Minimalism and asymmetry. Building a company and a product from bottom up, with no external venture capital, by their own and their customers' forces; take the market an asymmetric way: a small, agile team can napster a well established product or market with simpler but more usable solution.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    37Signals decomposed everything, trim the fat, and put together something revolutionary which imprinted people's mind. From now on people were not afraid to quit their job and start a company; instead of running after capital to start up they've created a simple, minimum viable product in weeks and started selling directly to customers; the revenue was invested back into the product instead of fancy offices, expensive CEOs and advertising. The product became the message.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This new paradigm also shifted web technology. From web servers to databases and programming languages everything was reformed. Soon all web technology became like the web itself: open, built on little components, organized into powerful and evolvable networks.

    Thanks 37Signals, Welcome Modern Web.
