    While TYPO3 made content management easy for enterprises Wordpress made it easy for people starting a new era in web history: blogging, or self-publishing.

    Wordpress was differrent than anything else before at two fronts: it made content personal and viral. At a moment every company or every professional had a blog and a community built around through a smart commenting system. Every content piece interconnected via feeds let people be notified real-time about what's happening with their content and in that part of the blogosphere they were interested. Everybody could become a content hero overnight.

    Self publishing cut the middlemen. You don't had to buy a book about a hot topic when you could read posts of the author on the blog. Then find out from comments who else is expert in the subject, or, check out the blogroll&mdash;a small network of most important related authors and blogs&mdash;for more.

    Even Google went ignored when searching for knowledge; Technorati, Delicious, Stumble Upon & co were the new search engines of this new medium.
