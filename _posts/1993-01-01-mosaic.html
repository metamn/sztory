  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Quickly turned out Andreeseen is gifted also in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a huge success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model is used even today with various small modifications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services gently offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it previously with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model.
