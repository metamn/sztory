  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.

    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.
