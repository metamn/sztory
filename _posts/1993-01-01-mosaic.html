  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on web pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreessen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, pulling the web out from academic environment to desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on <abbr>PC/Mac</abbr> as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreessen has talent in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of Silicon Graphics, a supercomputer giant they've started a new company Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, one of the first web startups.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competition springing up from the mushrooming Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a success&mdash;de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The freemium business model they've invented&mdash;a combination of free liceneces for personal, and paid licence for commercial use&mdash;also became a standard on the internet and used even today.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreessen needed a Goliath&mdash;services offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it with Windows in desktop operating systems. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Netscape and Microdoft started the first browser and involved everybody from web producers to web surfers. Some websites worked well in a browser but broken in another; Internet Explorer came preinstalled with Windows making people think there is no alternative to browsing; developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; the cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled during the war.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Andresseen won. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when the successor of Netscape, The Mozilla Foundation is a cornerstone. Andreessen sold Netscape to <abbr>AOL</abbr> for a stunning $4.2bn and established himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his investment portfolio.
