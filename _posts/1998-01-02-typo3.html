  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a huge success.

  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then it was translated to web by a developer and deployed to to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this magic circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Too many middlemen.
