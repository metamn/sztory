  <h3>CSS</h3>
  
  <p>
    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like HTML and CSS, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    W3C&mdash;the international web standards consortium meant to provide uniform syntax to structure (HTML) and style (CSS) web sites&mdash;was continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good in Internet Explorer and broke other browsers like Netscape.

  <p>
    Eric Meyer started to restore the native spirit of the web, openness, jeopardized by business goals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which lets web designers add art to web documents.

  <p>
    Although named 'The King of CSS' Meyer still stays low, underdog style, representing thousands of peer geniuses keeping the web working, open and alive.

    Almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called 'CSS reset', ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results.
