  <h3>CSS</h3>
  
  <p>
    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The recommandations of the World Wide Web Consortium&mdash;<abbr>W3C</abbr>, the international web standards body meant to provide uniform syntax to structure and style (<abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>) web sites&mdash;were continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good either in Internet Explorer or Netscape. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Everything was a mess when Eric Meyer in 1993 started to restore the native spirit of the web, openness, jeopardized by business goals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr>CSS</abbr>) which lets web designers add art to web pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named &ldquo;The King of <abbr>CSS</abbr>&rdquo; Meyer is still an underdog representing thousands of contributors keeping the web working and open. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called &ldquo;<abbr>CSS</abbr> reset&rdquo;, ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results and web pages look elegant in all browsers.
