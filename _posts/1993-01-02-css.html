  <h3>CSS</h3>
  
  <p>
    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like HTML and CSS, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    W3C&mdash;the international web standards consortium meant to provide uniform syntax to structure (HTML) and style (CSS) web sites&mdash;was continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good only in Internet Explorer and broke other browsers like Netscape. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The native spirit of the web, openness, was jeopardized by business goals until Eric Meyer came to the rescue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career to bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of web standards, especially Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which lets web designers add art to web documents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named 'The King of CSS' Meyer still stays low, underdog style, representing thousands of peer geniuses working silently on keeping the web working, open and alive. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few might know almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called 'CSS reset', ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results.
