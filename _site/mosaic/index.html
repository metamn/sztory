  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on web pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen has talent in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competition springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model works even today.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first browser war started and involved everybody from producers to web surfers. Some websites worked well in a browser but broken in another; Internet Explorer came preinstalled with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war went to Andreeseen even if this first fight went Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and established himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.
