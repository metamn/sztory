 At age 34 Timothy Berners-Lee—"TimBL" on the net—invents the world wide web as we know today.

Between 1989-1994 he and his team at CERN (an European organization for research) created the first website together with the first web server.

Technologies used in his invention—HTTP—Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTML—Hypertext Markup Language—are still the foundations of every website today.

The internet was a lively place even before the web.

People built communities via Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) , they were participating in forums and newsgroups with Usenet , exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.

The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.

The 'dumb' terminal browser made room for graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. Visual web content editors enabled non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.

This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure it will stay open.

In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.
