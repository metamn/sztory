    While TYPO3 made content management easy for enterprise Wordpress made it easy for people starting a new era in web history: blogging, or self-publishing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The easy to use and fully customizable nature of Wordpress made non-technical people enjoy content creation for the web. Later this elevated to an alarming level for the media, advertising and education industry since they've been napstered by high quality and fast, better interconnected content created by large, well-educated masses.

<article class="article text summary">
  <h3></h3>
  
  <p>
    Wordpress was different than anything else before at two fronts: it made content personal and viral. At a moment every company or every professional had a blog and a community built around through a smart commenting system. Every content piece interconnected via feeds let people be notified real-time about what's happening with their content, and more, on that part of the blogosphere they were interested. Everybody could become a content hero overnight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Self publishing cut the middlemen. You don't had to buy a book about a hot topic when you could read posts of the author on the blog. You could find out from comments who else is expert in the subject or check out a small network of most important related authors and blogs&mdash;the blogroll.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Technorati, Delicious, Stumble Upon & co were the new search engines of this new medium. Ecosystems sprung around every imaginable topic. Professionals started to leave their jobs and live from blogging. Knowledge, information and communication had a renaissance.
