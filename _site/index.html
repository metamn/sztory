  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  
  <p>
    At age 34 Timothy Berners-Lee&mdash;"TimBL" on the net&mdash;invents the world wide web as we know today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 1989-1994 he and his team at CERN (an European organization for research) created the first website together with the first web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technologies used in his invention&mdash;HTTP&mdash;Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTML&mdash;Hypertext Markup Language&mdash;are still the foundations of every website today.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System">Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</a>


, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet">Usenet</a>


, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rapidly the 'dumb' terminal browser was replaced with graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) web content editors were created to enable non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure their founding principles of openness are kept.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen is gifted also in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a huge success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model is used even today with various small modifications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services gently offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it previously with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the first browser war started everybody involved in producing and enjoying web sites was concerned. Suddenly some websites were displayed correctly in a browser and broken in the another; Internet Explorer came pre-installed with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war was won by Andreeseen even if this first fight went to Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and estabilished himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.

  <h3>CSS</h3>
  
  <p>
    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like HTML and CSS, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    W3C&mdash;the international web standards consortium meant to provide uniform syntax to structure (HTML) and style (CSS) web sites&mdash;was continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good only in Internet Explorer and broke other browsers like Netscape. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The native spirit of the web, openness, was jeopardized by business goals until Eric Meyer came to the rescue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career to bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of web standards, especially Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which lets web designers add art to web documents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named 'The King of CSS' Meyer still stays low, underdog style, representing thousands of peer geniuses working silently on keeping the web working, open and alive. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few might know almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called 'CSS reset', ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results.

    In the first years the World Wild Web looks funny; there were no web designers, web developers, user experience engineers but sysadmins and webadmins. Mostly with Computer Science background these gatekeepers of the web came up with ... khmm ... strange visual solutions.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  
  <p>
    At age 34 Timothy Berners-Lee&mdash;"TimBL" on the net&mdash;invents the world wide web as we know today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 1989-1994 he and his team at CERN (an European organization for research) created the first website together with the first web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technologies used in his invention&mdash;HTTP&mdash;Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTML&mdash;Hypertext Markup Language&mdash;are still the foundations of every website today.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System">Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</a>


, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet">Usenet</a>


, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rapidly the 'dumb' terminal browser was replaced with graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) web content editors were created to enable non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure their founding principles of openness are kept.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen is gifted also in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a huge success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model is used even today with various small modifications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services gently offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it previously with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the first browser war started everybody involved in producing and enjoying web sites was concerned. Suddenly some websites were displayed correctly in a browser and broken in the another; Internet Explorer came pre-installed with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war was won by Andreeseen even if this first fight went to Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and estabilished himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.

    In the first years the World Wild Web looks funny; there were no web designers, web developers, user experience engineers but sysadmins and webadmins. Mostly with Computer Science background these gatekeepers of the web came up with ... khmm ... strange visual solutions.

  <h1>Eric Meyer and the CSS</h1>

  <h3>CSS</h3>
  
  <p>
    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like HTML and CSS, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    W3C&mdash;the international web standards consortium meant to provide uniform syntax to structure (HTML) and style (CSS) web sites&mdash;was continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good only in Internet Explorer and broke other browsers like Netscape. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The native spirit of the web, openness, was jeopardized by business goals until Eric Meyer came to the rescue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career to bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of web standards, especially Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which lets web designers add art to web documents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named 'The King of CSS' Meyer still stays low, underdog style, representing thousands of peer geniuses working silently on keeping the web working, open and alive. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few might know almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called 'CSS reset', ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System">Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</a>


, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet">Usenet</a>


, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rapidly the 'dumb' terminal browser was replaced with graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) web content editors were created to enable non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure their founding principles of openness are kept.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen is gifted also in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a huge success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model is used even today with various small modifications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services gently offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it previously with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the first browser war started everybody involved in producing and enjoying web sites was concerned. Suddenly some websites were displayed correctly in a browser and broken in the another; Internet Explorer came pre-installed with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war was won by Andreeseen even if this first fight went to Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and estabilished himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.

    While other pioneers were working on the web infrastructure&mdash;the browser, structuring (HTML) and styling (CSS) content&mdash; Nielsen started to think with the readers and users mind. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the first years the World Wild Web looks funny; there were no web designers, web developers, user experience engineers but sysadmins and webadmins. Mostly with Computer Science background these gatekeepers of the web came up with ... khmm ... strange visual solutions.

    Nielsen started to research what makes websites work, how to deliver the message in this shiny new medium. He was not focused on graphic design&mdash;typography, layout, colors, icons, etc.&mdash; but influencing visistor's behaviour in such way to achieve a goal like clicking a button which, for example, has the 'Purchase' text on it.

    Many of his results are de-facto standard in today's web user interface design:
