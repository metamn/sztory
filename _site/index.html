  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on web pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreessen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, pulling the web out from academic environment to desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on <abbr>PC/Mac</abbr> as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.  
  </p>
</article>


<article class="article text">
  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreessen has talent in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of Silicon Graphics, a supercomputer giant they've started a new company Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, one of the first web startups.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competition springing up from the mushrooming Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a success&mdash;de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The freemium business model they've invented&mdash;a combination of free liceneces for personal, and paid licence for commercial use&mdash;also became a standard on the internet and used even today.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreessen needed a Goliath&mdash;services offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it with Windows in desktop operating systems. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Netscape and Microdoft started the first browser and involved everybody from web producers to web surfers. Some websites worked well in a browser but broken in another; Internet Explorer came preinstalled with Windows making people think there is no alternative to browsing; developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; the cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled during the war.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Andresseen won. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when the successor of Netscape, The Mozilla Foundation is a cornerstone. Andreessen sold Netscape to <abbr>AOL</abbr> for a stunning $4.2bn and established himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his investment portfolio.

    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The recommandations of the World Wide Web Consortium&mdash;<abbr>W3C</abbr>, the international web standards body meant to provide uniform syntax to structure and style (<abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>) web sites&mdash;were continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good either in Internet Explorer or Netscape. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Everything was a mess when Eric Meyer in 1993 started to restore the native spirit of the web, openness, jeopardized by business goals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr>CSS</abbr>) which lets web designers add art to web pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named &ldquo;The King of <abbr>CSS</abbr>&rdquo; Meyer is still an underdog representing thousands of contributors keeping the web working and open. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called &ldquo;<abbr>CSS</abbr> reset&rdquo;, ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results and web pages look elegant in all browsers.

    Nielsen started to research what makes websites work, how to deliver the message in this new medium. He was not focused on graphic design&mdash;typography, layout, colors, icons, etc.&mdash; but on how to influence visitors' behaviour in such way to achieve a goal like clicking a button.

    Flash was fresh air for web and made everybody happy. Advertisers could have now animated banners, web designers and developers could create fully animated websites, games found home in the browser, scientists show us magic with animated visualizations, print designers could embed their best of typography and fonts into websites.

  <h3>The End Of Flash</h3>
  
  <p>
    Some success stories come to an end. More often those who ignore the basic rules. Flash violated the first rule of the internet, the openness. Like a black box inside the web browser nobody knew what's inside. Even Google could not figure out what a Flash site is and penalized them in search results. The mobile revolution took on surprise Flash and it's parent company Adobe with no community behind it's closed source code. In 2011 the black box grew over the mobile device and nobody could save this wonder technology from disappearance.

  <h3>Photoshop</h3>
  
  <p>
    Created in 1988&mdash;when Tim Berners-Lee started to work on the web&mdash;Photoshop was a successful tool for manipulating images and photographs. Everybody was using it to design stories for print. Together with other Adobe products like Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects, Photoshop was the swiss army knife of publishing, advertising and visual creativity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For these creatives the web was a strange land. It's HTML and CSS was far beyond the capabilities and expectations of those who mastered delighting the world with graphics. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the introduction of the 'Save for Web' feature in 1998 Photoshop made a step forward in making print pixels friend with web pixels, blurring the line between the two mediums and import the waste knowledge from the publishing industry into online.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A new revolution started. Webmasters were replaced by web designers and web developers; creative people were drawing beautiful web pages in Photoshop and programmers were translating them to web. Online divisions were created in advertising agencies and publishing houses; Everybody started to think in full scale offering solutions for all platforms from print to web.

  <h3>Today</h3>
  
  <p>
    Today Photoshop is still a force in web design&mdash;by showing a considerable decline. Again, the mobile web disrupted a technology which was not web native. With the advent of different displays, from mobile screens to large projectors and the advancement in native web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript &mdash; designing in the browser and cutting the Photoshop intermediary step is more viable both commercially and professionally.

  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a success. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then translated to web by a developer and deployed to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Middlemen everywhere.
  </p>
</article>

<article class="article image">
  <h3>The Old Workflow</h3>
</article>

<article class="articla text summary">
  <h3>Managing content</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enter TYPO3. A so called Content Management System (CMS) meant to cut at least one middlemen, the sysadmin, and definitively improve the content creation process empowering the content creator, not the designer and the developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CMS was a step forward for the media industry. Content people could log in to an online dashboard, create articles and posts and publish them. The page design and the associated web code were initially created by designers and developers&mdash;their further task remained to style periodically new content types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Deployment and server infrastructure was fully transparent too. In this pure environment content became reigning and people started to create content on their own enabling the blogging revolution.

    It's a modern hybrid influencing the web in various ways. Maybe their biggest impact was demystifying business and make web people entrepreneurs, but also their contribution to decompose technology in smaller stacks will be probably a historical move.

  <h3>The idols</h3>
  
  <p>
    The company was founded by Jason Fried, a web designer who realized building web applications instead of web sites is a viable business. His company's thinking and work  disrupted the entire establishment introducing new concepts like self-founding startups, software as a service, simple and small means power.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Together with partner and rockstar developer David Heinemeier Hansson they've brought modernism to web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Minimalism and asymmetry. Building a company and a product from bottom up, with no external venture capital, by their own and their customers' forces; take the market an asymmetric way: a small, agile team can napster a well established product or market with simpler but more usable solution.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    37Signals decomposed everything, trim the fat, and put together something revolutionary which imprinted people's mind. From now on people were not afraid to quit their job and start a company; instead of running after capital to start up they've created a simple, minimum viable product in weeks and started selling directly to customers; the revenue was invested back into the product instead of fancy offices, expensive CEOs and advertising. The product became the message.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This new paradigm also shifted web technology. From web servers to databases and programming languages everything was reformed. Soon all web technology became like the web itself: open, built on little components, organized into powerful and evolvable networks.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thanks 37Signals, Welcome Modern Web.

    While TYPO3 made content management easy for enterprise Wordpress made it easy for people starting a new era in web history: blogging, or self-publishing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The easy to use and fully customizable nature of Wordpress made non-technical people enjoy content creation for the web. Later this elevated to an alarming level for the media, advertising and education industry since they've been napstered by high quality and fast, better interconnected content created by large, well-educated masses.

  <p>
    Wordpress was different than anything else before at two fronts: it made content personal and viral. At a moment every company or every professional had a blog and a community built around through a smart commenting system. Every content piece interconnected via feeds let people be notified real-time about what's happening with their content, and more, on that part of the blogosphere they were interested. Everybody could become a content hero overnight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Self publishing cut the middlemen. You don't had to buy a book about a hot topic when you could read posts of the author on the blog. You could find out from comments who else is expert in the subject or check out a small network of most important related authors and blogs&mdash;the blogroll.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Technorati, Delicious, Stumble Upon & co were the new search engines of this new medium. Ecosystems sprung around every imaginable topic. Professionals started to leave their jobs and live from blogging. Knowledge, information and communication had a renaissance.

    Year by year it become easier to create, publish, distribute, consume and monetize content and services on the web&mdash;not just for companies but for all. The web made it's way through obstacles, learnt what's best from competition and napstered industries and minds. In ten years it became an universal platform and medium with it's own rules.

    The underlying standard technologies CSS and HTML evolved slower. In 25 years CSS still didn't managed to grow up three levels while HTML was already 5 and the web migrated from our desktops to our pockets and now to our watches and shoes.

    W3C, the consortium behind web standards is the political body of the web. Members are businesses, non-profits, universities, government and individuals lead by Tim Berners-Lee the father of the web. They are working on a global consensus&mdash;like world peace&mdash;to shape the future of the web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost nobody hears about the W3C, about their progress and works. Official documents are written in a language few can decipher; periodically the most skilled professionals pick up small new pieces from these documents and present in a digestible format to the web design and development community. Which then creates patches, workarounds and force somehow these advancements to work in the latest browser editions. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The responsive, mobile web is around since 2009 where a critical task is to present different sized images on different displays for a better user experience. Today after five years the W3C still did not managed to come up with a standard way for responsive images implemented in all major browsers.

    Into this sad state of web standards and politics Dave Shea brought some enlightenment showcasing what's possible with CSS design.

    Fact is the native apps and ubiquitous networks combination changed definitively the web landscape.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What started initially by Wordpress and Web 2.0 as a large scale, open participation and syndication of user generated content&mdash;in a few years transformed into social networks and defaced the web. Today what matters for the majority of internauts is the social content stream hitting constantly their devices. And this has nothing to do with the web, it's the opposite.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web was built on openness while all social networks are closed: login for access. The web was built on clicks while the networks are a pull to refresh. The web meant active discovery&mdash;the networks are guarded by app stores. The web has universal standards and open decision making&mdash;HTML, CSS, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)&mdash;when network technology is controlled exclusively by private companies. On the web self-privacy was natural when in networks is inexistent. On the web you were a product for Google and Yahoo now on networks you are a product even for your weather app.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Due to human nature this won't change. Apps will always dominate the stream, the surface of the digital universe. What is beyond&mdash;a step back and a closer look&mdash;will stay in the realm of the web and now partners-in-history, the books and printed magazines.

    In the last seven years of mobile apps and networks, multi-billion dollar acquisitions coming out from nowhere, international privacy scandals, and with the Internet of Things on radar the picture is clear. The web will stay as a second class citizen, as a set of interconnected and open websites with high quality content, when first class will be taken by signals collected into ubiquitous and uniform streams from everything and everybody on Earth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a little bit eliberating for creatives and thinkers. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As taking a book or a magazine for relaxation, entertainment and deep learning&mdash;the web will become the same companion. Daytime we will be guided by the living things around and we will flow with the stream. When looking for something outstanding, or want to produce something interesting we will use the web.
