  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  
  <p>
    At age 34 Timothy Berners-Lee&mdash;"TimBL" on the net&mdash;invents the world wide web as we know today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 1989-1994 he and his team at CERN (an European organization for research) created the first website together with the first web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technologies used in his invention&mdash;HTTP&mdash;Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTML&mdash;Hypertext Markup Language&mdash;are still the foundations of every website today.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System">Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</a>


, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet">Usenet</a>


, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The 'dumb' terminal browser made room for graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. Visual web content editors enabled non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure it will stay open.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen has talent in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model works even today.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first browser war started and involved everybody from producers to web surfers. Some websites worked well in a browser but broken in another; Internet Explorer came pre-installed with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war went to Andreeseen even if this first fight went Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and estabilished himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.

  <h3>CSS</h3>
  
  <p>
    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like HTML and CSS, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    W3C&mdash;the international web standards consortium meant to provide uniform syntax to structure (HTML) and style (CSS) web sites&mdash;was continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good in Internet Explorer and broke other browsers like Netscape. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Eric Meyer started to restore the native spirit of the web, openness, jeopardized by business goals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which lets web designers add art to web documents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named 'The King of CSS' Meyer still stays low, underdog style, representing thousands of peer geniuses keeping the web working, open and alive. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called 'CSS reset', ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results.

  <h3>Photoshop</h3>
  
  <p>
    Created in 1988&mdash;when Tim Berners-Lee started to work on the web&mdash;Photoshop was a basic tool for manipulating images and photographs. Everybody was using it to tell stories on paper and outdoor displays. Together with other Adobe products like Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects,  Photoshop was the swiss army knife of publishing, advertising and visual creativity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For these creatives the web was a strange land. It's HTML and CSS was far beyond the capabilities and expectations of those who mastered delighting the world with graphics. The web was not even a step-brother for the creative mind.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the introduction of the 'Save for Web' feature in 1998 Photoshop made a step forward in making print pixels friend with web pixels, blurring the line between the two mediums, paper and monitor, and, import the waste knowledge from the publishing industry into online.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A new revolution started. Webmasters were replaced by web designers and web developers; creative people were drawing beautiful web pages in Photoshop and programmers were translating them to web. Online divisions were created in advertising agencies and publishing houses; Everybody started to think in full scale offering solutions for all platforms, including the web.

  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a success. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then translated to web by a developer and deployed to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this magic circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Middlemen everywhere.

  <h3>The Old Workflow</h3>

<article class="articla text summary">
  <h3>Managing content</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enter Typo3. A so calledd Content Management System (CMS) meant to cut at least one middlemen, the sysadmin, and definitively improve the content creation process empowering the content creator, not the designer and the developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CMS was a step forward for the media industry. Content people could log in to an online dashboard, create articles and posts and publish them. The design and the associated web code were initially created by designers and developers&mdash;their further task remained to style periodically new content types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Deployment and server infrastructure was fully transparent too. In this pure environment content became reigning and people started to create content in it's own enabling the blogging revolution which lead to social networks.

  <h1>37 Signals turns a designer into entrepreneur</h1>

  <h3>The company</h3>
  
  <p>
    The Chicago&mdash;more precisely&mdash;worldwide based, quasi officeless company 37Signals is pretty unique on the web palette. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's a modern hybrid influencing the web in many ways. Maybe their biggest impact was demistifying business and make web people entrepreneurs, but also their contribution to decompose technology in smaller stacks will be probably a historical move.

  <h3>The idols</h3>
  
  <p>
    The company was founded by Jason Fried, a web designer who realized building web applications instead of web sites is a viable business. Moreover, his thinking distrupted the entire establishment introducing new concepts like self-founding startups, software as a service, simple and small means power.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Together with partner and rockstar developer David Heinemeier Hansson they've brought modernism to web, from all aspects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Modernism is built on minimalism and asymmetry. In 37Signals' case that meant building a company and a product from bottom up, with no external venture capital, by their own and their customers' forces. Aside this minimal business model their take on the market was asymmetric: a small, agile team took relentlessly over a giant (Microsoft) napstering their project planning and management division.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In their entire activity and presence they've decomposed everything, trim the fat, and put together something revolutionary which imprinted people's mind. From now on people were not afraid to quit their daily job and start a company; instead of running after capital to start up they've created a simple, minimum viable product in a few weeks and started selling directly to customers; the revenue was invested back into the product instead of fancy offices, expensive CEOs and advertising. The product became the message.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This new paradigm also shifted web technology. From web servers to databases and programming languages everything was reformed. Soon all web technology became like the web itself: open, built on little components, organized into powerful and evolvable networks.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thanks 37Signals, Welcome Modern Web.

  <h1>Wordpress makes blogging easy</h1>

  <p>
    While TYPO3 made content management easy for enterprises Wordpress made it easy for people starting a new era in web history: blogging, or self-publishing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The easy to use and fully customizable nature of Wordpress made non-technical people enjoy content creation for the web. Later this elevated to an alarming level for the media, advertising and education industry&nbsp;they've been napstered by high quality and fast, better interconnected content created by large, well-educated masses.

  <h3>Wordpress vs. old media google trends</h3>

<article class="article text summary">
  <h3></h3>
  
  <p>
    Wordpress was differrent than anything else before at two fronts: it made content personal and viral. At a moment every company or every professional had a blog and a community built around through a smart commenting system. Every content piece was interconnected via feeds and people were notified real-time about what's happening with their content and in that part of the blogosphere they were interested. Everybody could become a content hero overnight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Self publishing cut the middlemen. You don't had to buy a book about a hot topic when you could read the almost daily posts of the author on the blog. Then find out from comments who else is expert in the subject, or, check out the blogroll&mdash;a small network of most important related authors and blogs&mdash;for more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also Google was ignored when searching for information but more exactly knowledge; Technorati, Delicious, Stumble Upon & co were the new search for this new medium.

    Year by year it become easier to create, publish, distribute, consume and monetize content and services on the web&mdash;not just for companies but for all. The web made it's way through many obstacles, learnt what's best from competion and napstered industries and minds. In ten years it became an universal platform and medium with it's own rules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The underlying standard technologies CSS (for style) and HTML (for structure) evolved&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;much slower. In 25 years CSS still didn't managed to grow up three levels while HTML5 is already mature, and meantime the web migrated from our desktops to our pockets and recently to our watches and shoes.

    W3C, the consortium behind web standards it seems to be the political body of the web. Members are businesses, non-profits, universities, government and individuals lead by Tim Berners-Lee the father of the web. They are working on a global consensus&mdash;like world peace&mdash;to shape the future of the web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost nobody hears about the W3C, about their progress and works. Official documents are written in a language few can decipher; periodically the most skilled professionals pick up small new pieces from these documents and present in a digestible format to the web design and development community. Which then creates patches, workarounds and force somehow these advancements to work in the latest browser editions. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The responsive, mobile web is around since 2009 where a critical task is to present different sized images on different displays for a better user experience. Today after five years the W3C still did not managed to come up with a standard way for responsive images.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's the sad state of web standards and politics where advancements are brought many times by huge efforts done by lonely professionals. Like Eric Meyer, and, the hero if this timeline entry, Dave Shea who tries to bring some enlightment for the web with showcasing what's currently possible with CSS design.

    Javascript is the native programming language of the web since the first true web browser, Netscape, and hit mainstream with jQuery which makes easy to add subtle navigation to menus, to hide and reveal content in a smooth manner, to refresh on-the-fly data on websites like the content of your shopping cart.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Beside lifting the user experience on the web to a highly enjoyable state, jQuery made web developers worldwide to forget general purpose programming languages when programming for web. A set of new Javascript frameworks are spinning up reguralry to collect, prepare, structure and deliver web data. Javascript is what glues together information when traveling from servers to our eyes.

    With jQuery and Javascript the content come closer to us in a natural way.

  <p>
    Fact is this combo&mdash;native apps and ubiquoitous networks&mdash; changed definitively the web landscape.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What started initially by Wordpress and Web 2.0 as a large scale, open participation and syndication of user generated content&mdash;in a few years&mdash;completely defaced the web. Today what matters for the vast majority of internauts is the stream hitting constantly their devices. And this has nothing to do with the web, it is the straight opposite.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web was built on openness while all social networks are closed: login for access. The web was built on clicks while the networks are a pull to refresh. The web meant active discovery the networks are guarded by app stores. The web has universal standards and open decision making&mdash;HTML, CSS, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)&mdash;when networks are controlled exclusivley by private companies. On the web self-privacy was natural when in networks is inexistent. On the web you were a product only for Google and Yahoo now on networks even for your weather app.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Due to human nature this won't change. Apps will always dominate the stream, the surface of the digital universe. What is beyond&mdash;a step back and a closer look&mdash;will stay in the realm of the web and now partners-in-history, the books and printed magazines.

  <p>
    In the last seven years of mobile apps and networks, multi-billion dollar acquisitions in this market coming out from nowhere, international privacy scandals, and with the Internet of Things on radar the picture is clear. The web will stay as a second class citizen, as a set of interconnected and open websites with high quality content, when first class will be taken by signals collected into ubiquoutos and uniform streams from everything and everybody on Earth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a little bit eliberating for creatives and thinkers. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As taking a book or a magazine for relaxation, entertainment and deep learning&mdash;the web will become the same companion. Daytime we will be guided by the living things around and we will flow with the stream. When looking for something outstanding, or want to produce something interesting we will use the web.

    It's no surprise New York Times 'invented' storytelling. They've learnt how to survive the print-to-digital metasystem transformation with a paywall and better content. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The good news for the web is that finally matured to a level to rival television. With motion picture embedded in recent websites, the full typographic arsenal domesticated from the print industry, games running in the browser&mdash;the web mixed up what was best in old mediums, and, by it's nature, made it open and available to large communities to assure it's own evolution.
