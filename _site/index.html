  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  
  <p>
    At age 34 Timothy Berners-Lee&mdash;"TimBL" on the net&mdash;invents the world wide web as we know today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 1989-1994 he and his team at CERN (an European organization for research) created the first website together with the first web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technologies used in his invention&mdash;HTTP&mdash;Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTML&mdash;Hypertext Markup Language&mdash;are still the foundations of every website today.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System">Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</a>


, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet">Usenet</a>


, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rapidly the 'dumb' terminal browser was replaced with graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) web content editors were created to enable non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure their founding principles of openness are kept.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen is gifted also in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a huge success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model is used even today with various small modifications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services gently offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it previously with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the first browser war started everybody involved in producing and enjoying web sites was concerned. Suddenly some websites were displayed correctly in a browser and broken in the another; Internet Explorer came pre-installed with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war was won by Andreeseen even if this first fight went to Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and estabilished himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.

  <h3>CSS</h3>
  
  <p>
    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like HTML and CSS, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    W3C&mdash;the international web standards consortium meant to provide uniform syntax to structure (HTML) and style (CSS) web sites&mdash;was continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good only in Internet Explorer and broke other browsers like Netscape. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The native spirit of the web, openness, was jeopardized by business goals until Eric Meyer came to the rescue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career to bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of web standards, especially Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which lets web designers add art to web documents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named 'The King of CSS' Meyer still stays low, underdog style, representing thousands of peer geniuses working silently on keeping the web working, open and alive. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few might know almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called 'CSS reset', ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results.

    There are some success stories which come to and end. More often those who ignore the basic rules. Flash, from inception violated the first rule of the internet, the openness. It was like a black box inside the web browser: nobody knew what was inside. Even Google could not figure out what a Flash site is and penalized them in search results. Being closed source &mdash;with no community behind it's code base&mdash;the mobile revolution took on surprise Flash, and it's parent company Adobe. In 2011 the black box grew over the tiny device and even a powerful company couldn't save this wonder technology from disappearance.

  <h3>Photoshop</h3>
  
  <p>
    Created in 1988&mdash;when Tim Berners-Lee started to work on the web&mdash;Photoshop was a basic tool for manipulating images and photographs. Everybody was using it to tell stories on paper and outdoor displays. Together with other Adobe products like Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects it was the swiss army knife of publishing, advertising and visual creativity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For these creatives the web was a strange land. It's HTML and CSS was far beyond the capabilities and expectations of those who mastered delighting the world with graphics. The web was not even a step-brother for the creative mind.

  <p>
    With the introduction of the 'Save for Web' feature in 1998 Photoshop made a huge step making print pixels friend with web pixels, blurring the line between the two mediums, paper and monitor, and, import the waste knowledge from the publishing industry into online.

  <p>
    A new revolution started. Webmasters were replaced by web designers and web developers; creative people were drawing beautiful web pages in Photoshop and programmers were translating them to web. Online divisions were created in advertising agencies and publishing houses; Everybody started to think in full scale offering solutions for all platforms, including the web.

  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a huge success. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then it was translated to web by a developer and deployed to to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this magic circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Too many middlemen.

<article class="article image">
  <h3>The Old Workflow</h3>
</article>

<article class="articla text summary">
  <h3>Managing content</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enter Typo3. A so calledd Content Management System (CMS) meant to cut at least one middlemen, the sysadmin, and definitively improve the content creation process empowering the content creator, not the designer and the developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CMS was a huge step forward for the media industry. Content people could log in to an online dashboard, create articles and posts which were immediately published. The design and the associated web code were initially created by designers and developers&mdash;their further task remained to style periodically new content types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Deployment and server infrastructure was fully transparent too. In this pure environment content became reigning and many started to create content in it's own enabling the blogging revolution which lead to social networks.

    Founded by web designer legend Jeffrey Zeldman, The Magazine became the glue of the web. It was the school where every respectable web worker went to learn twice a month. If you wanted to make a name in the industry, or, raise a topic which changed the industry you went to A List Apart. After 16 years&mdash;infinite in web time&mdash;you still do.

  <h3>The Community</h3>
  
  <p>
    The first rule of the web, openness, implies participation and builds communities. No technology in this fast environment can survive and thrive without strong, continuous support from people. Not companies and organizations but people who live, love and share unconditionally that particular technology.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A List Apart is such a classic community. Everything important related to websites flows through this channel. Topics discussed here are the pulse of the web. Problems presented here are universal and the solutions are the best of their times. From strategy, process, execution and experience to the state of the web here you can find the best answers for your questions.

  <h3>The company</h3>
  
  <p>
    The Chicago&mdash;more precisely&mdash;worldwide based, quasi officeless company 37Signals is pretty unique on the web palette. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's a modern hybrid influencing the web in many ways. Maybe their biggest impact was demistifying business and make web people entrepreneurs, but also their contribution to decompose technology in smaller stacks will be probably a historical move.

<article class="article summary text">
  <h3>The idols</h3>
  
  <p>
    The company was founded by Jason Fried, a web designer who realized building web applications instead of web sites is a viable business. Moreover, his thinking distrupted the entire establishment introducing new concepts like self-founding startups, software as a service, simple and small means power.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Together with partner and rockstar developer David Heinemeier Hansson they've brought modernism to web, from all aspects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Modernism is built on minimalism and asymmetry. In 37Signals' case that meant building a company and a product from bottom up, with no external venture capital, by their own and their customers' forces. Aside this minimal business model their take on the market was asymmetric: a small, agile team took relentlessly over a giant (Microsoft) napstering their project planning and management division.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In their entire activity and presence they've decomposed everything, trim the fat, and put together something revolutionary which imprinted people's mind. From now on people were not afraid to quit their daily job and start a company; instead of running after capital to start up they've created a simple, minimum viable product in a few weeks and started selling directly to customers; the revenue was invested back into the product instead of fancy offices, expensive CEOs and advertising. The product became the message.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This new paradigm also shifted web technology. From web servers to databases and programming languages everything was reformed. Soon all web technology became like the web itself: open, built on little components, organized into powerful and evolvable networks.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thanks 37Signals, Welcome Modern Web.

  <p>
    While TYPO3 made content management easy for enterprises Wordpress made it easy for people starting a new era in web history: blogging, or self-publishing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The easy to use and fully customizable nature of Wordpress made non-technical people enjoy content creation for the web. Later this elevated to an alarming level for the media, advertising and education industry&nbsp;they've been napstered by high quality and fast, better interconnected content created by large, well-educated masses.

  <h3>Wordpress vs. old media google trends</h3>
</article>

<article class="article text summary">
  <h3></h3>
  
  <p>
    Wordpress was differrent than anything else before at two fronts: it made content personal and viral. At a moment every company or every professional had a blog and a community built around through a smart commenting system. Every content piece was interconnected via feeds and people were notified real-time about what's happening with their content and in that part of the blogosphere they were interested. Everybody could become a content hero overnight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Self publishing cut the middlemen. You don't had to buy a book about a hot topic when you could read the almost daily posts of the author on the blog. Then find out from comments who else is expert in the subject, or, check out the blogroll&mdash;a small network of most important related authors and blogs&mdash;for more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also Google was ignored when searching for information but more exactly knowledge; Technorati, Delicious, Stumble Upon & co were the new search for this new medium.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  
  <p>
    At age 34 Timothy Berners-Lee&mdash;"TimBL" on the net&mdash;invents the world wide web as we know today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 1989-1994 he and his team at CERN (an European organization for research) created the first website together with the first web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technologies used in his invention&mdash;HTTP&mdash;Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTML&mdash;Hypertext Markup Language&mdash;are still the foundations of every website today.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System">Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</a>


, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet">Usenet</a>


, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rapidly the 'dumb' terminal browser was replaced with graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) web content editors were created to enable non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure their founding principles of openness are kept.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen is gifted also in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a huge success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model is used even today with various small modifications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services gently offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it previously with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the first browser war started everybody involved in producing and enjoying web sites was concerned. Suddenly some websites were displayed correctly in a browser and broken in the another; Internet Explorer came pre-installed with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war was won by Andreeseen even if this first fight went to Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and estabilished himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.

    As browsers took mainstream and companies started to battle over web dominance the underlying web technologies like HTML and CSS, and their results the web pages started to suffer a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    W3C&mdash;the international web standards consortium meant to provide uniform syntax to structure (HTML) and style (CSS) web sites&mdash;was continuously ignored by major browser providers like Microsoft. They've replaced international standards with a set of in-house built rules and made websites look good only in Internet Explorer and broke other browsers like Netscape.

    The native spirit of the web, openness, was jeopardized by business goals until Eric Meyer came to the rescue.

  <p>
    Meyer dedicated his entire professional career to bridging the gap between different browser interpretations of web standards, especially Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which lets web designers add art to web documents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although named 'The King of CSS' Meyer still stays low, underdog style, representing thousands of peer geniuses working silently on keeping the web working, open and alive. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few might know almost every website today contains a little piece of code by Eric, called 'CSS reset', ensuring every browser starts using the same set of display results.

    In the nineties with the success of Windows many PCs turned into game stations. Remember Wolfenstein 3D and Doom?

    As the browser emerged into a new universal platform the need to make it gaming friendly was an urge.

    There are some success stories which come to and end. More often those who ignore the basic rules. Flash, from inception violated the first rule of the internet, the openness. It was like a black box inside the web browser: nobody knew what was inside. Even Google could not figure out what a Flash site is and penalized them in search results. Being closed source &mdash;with no community behind it's code base&mdash;the mobile revolution took on surprise Flash, and it's parent company Adobe. In 2011 the black box grew over the tiny device and even a powerful company couldn't save this wonder technology from disappearance.

  <h3>Photoshop</h3>
  
  <p>
    Created in 1988&mdash;when Tim Berners-Lee started to work on the web&mdash;Photoshop was a basic tool for manipulating images and photographs. Everybody was using it to tell stories on paper and outdoor displays. Together with other Adobe products like Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects it was the swiss army knife of publishing, advertising and visual creativity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For these creatives the web was a strange land. It's HTML and CSS was far beyond the capabilities and expectations of those who mastered delighting the world with graphics. The web was not even a step-brother for the creative mind.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the introduction of the 'Save for Web' feature in 1998 Photoshop made a huge step making print pixels friend with web pixels, blurring the line between the two mediums, paper and monitor, and, import the waste knowledge from the publishing industry into online.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A new revolution started. Webmasters were replaced by web designers and web developers; creative people were drawing beautiful web pages in Photoshop and programmers were translating them to web. Online divisions were created in advertising agencies and publishing houses; Everybody started to think in full scale offering solutions for all platforms, including the web.

  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a huge success. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then it was translated to web by a developer and deployed to to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this magic circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Too many middlemen.

<article class="article image">
  <h3>The Old Workflow</h3>
</article>

<article class="articla text summary">
  <h3>Managing content</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enter Typo3. A so calledd Content Management System (CMS) meant to cut at least one middlemen, the sysadmin, and definitively improve the content creation process empowering the content creator, not the designer and the developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CMS was a huge step forward for the media industry. Content people could log in to an online dashboard, create articles and posts which were immediately published. The design and the associated web code were initially created by designers and developers&mdash;their further task remained to style periodically new content types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Deployment and server infrastructure was fully transparent too. In this pure environment content became reigning and many started to create content in it's own enabling the blogging revolution which lead to social networks.

  <p>
    While TYPO3 made content management easy for enterprises Wordpress made it easy for people starting a new era in web history: blogging, or self-publishing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The easy to use and fully customizable nature of Wordpress made non-technical people enjoy content creation for the web. Later this elevated to an alarming level for the media, advertising and education industry&nbsp;they've been napstered by high quality and fast, better interconnected content created by large, well-educated masses.

  <h3>Wordpress vs. old media google trends</h3>
</article>

<article class="article text summary">
  <h3></h3>
  
  <p>
    Wordpress was differrent than anything else before at two fronts: it made content personal and viral. At a moment every company or every professional had a blog and a community built around through a smart commenting system. Every content piece was interconnected via feeds and people were notified real-time about what's happening with their content and in that part of the blogosphere they were interested. Everybody could become a content hero overnight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Self publishing cut the middlemen. You don't had to buy a book about a hot topic when you could read the almost daily posts of the author on the blog. Then find out from comments who else is expert in the subject, or, check out the blogroll&mdash;a small network of most important related authors and blogs&mdash;for more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also Google was ignored when searching for information but more exactly knowledge; Technorati, Delicious, Stumble Upon & co were the new search for this new medium.

    At age 34 Timothy Berners-Lee&mdash;"TimBL" on the net&mdash;invents the world wide web as we know today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 1989-1994 he and his team at CERN (an European organization for research) created the first website together with the first web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technologies used in his invention&mdash;HTTP&mdash;Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTML&mdash;Hypertext Markup Language&mdash;are still the foundations of every website today.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
  <p>
    The internet was a lively place even before the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    People built communities via 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin Board System">Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</a>


, they were participating in forums and newsgroups with 
  
  



  



  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="usenet">Usenet</a>


, exchanging emails and files via technologies which still exists today: SMTP and FTP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web break through with links. By clicking from a website to another the World Wide Web became a network where discovery and participation was in the same way easy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rapidly the 'dumb' terminal browser was replaced with graphical browsers for a pleasant visualisation of websites. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) web content editors were created to enable non-scientist adding content to the web. Bloom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was the time when CERN made a bold move: they've released the World Wide Web source code to Public Domain. Now everybody on the world could contribute to the progress of the web and make sure their founding principles of openness are kept.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In five years the web grew over 10,000 servers and 10 million users including commercial players. The success was inevitable.

  <h3>Excerpt</h3>
  <p>
    The web created by Tim Berners-Lee was academic: interlinked research documents built mostly on text.
    Images were popping up in different windows, there were no colors and no design on webpages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter Marc Andreesseen and his friend Eric Bina. They have created the first popular browser, Mosaic, spinning out from academic environment to everyday desktop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now everybody could surf the web on PC/Mac as we do it today. There was no need for mainframes and cryptic operating systems.
    Mosaic quickly became the killer application the web needed and led to the first internet boom in the nineties.

  <h3>Netscape</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nobody thought but it turned out Andreeseen is gifted also in business not just in technology. With Bina and a former founder of the iconic Silicon Graphics International they've started up a new company, Netscape, meant to become famous in web history.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Netscape was, well, the first web startup.</p>
  
  <p>
    The problem was hard. Take the code from Mosaic, build a product which is still open source but also commercially viable, and face the competion springing up from the other Mosaic clones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The product became a huge success, the de-facto standard for web browsing. At it's peak in 1996 Netscape Navigator had a stunning 80% market share.
    <br/>
    The business model also became a standard on the internet: freemium, a combination of free and paid licences. In Netscape's case free for personal use, paid for commercial use. This model is used even today with various small modifications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To became an internet legend and a 21st century cyber hero Andreeseen needed a Goliath&mdash;services gently offered by then-tech-god Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Microsoft also built a browser based on Mosaic, the infamous Internet Explorer, and planned to roll out a monopoly over the web, as did it previously with Windows in desktop operating systems. Monopoly was their company culture and business model. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the first browser war started everybody involved in producing and enjoying web sites was concerned. Suddenly some websites were displayed correctly in a browser and broken in the another; Internet Explorer came pre-installed with Windows and let noobs think there is no alternative to browsing; Developers and designers had nightmare building for Explorer since Microsoft overruled the web standards; The cost of cross-browser compatible websites doubled or even tripled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The war was won by Andreeseen even if this first fight went to Microsoft. Today, after ten years Microsoft is non-significative in web when Mozilla, the successor of Netscape is a cornerstone. Andreeseen sold Netscape to AOL for a stunning $4.2bn and estabilished himself as one of the most respectable figures in the web business with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Github & co. in his company's portfolio.

    In the first years the World Wild Web looks funny; there were no web designers, web developers, user experience engineers but sysadmins and webmasters. Mostly with Computer Science background these gatekeepers of the web often came up with ... strange visual solutions.

    Nielsen started to research what makes websites work, how to deliver the message in this shiny new medium. He was not focused on graphic design&mdash;typography, layout, colors, icons, etc.&mdash; but influencing visistor's behaviour in such way to achieve a goal like clicking a button which, for example, has the 'Purchase' text on it.

    Many of his results are de-facto standard in today's web user interface design:

    In the nineties with the success of Windows many PCs turned into game stations. Remember Wolfenstein 3D and Doom?

    As the browser emerged into a new universal platform the need to make it gaming friendly was an urge.

    Game programmer Johnatan Gay saw this opportunity first and created a web environment where desktop-like animations were possible.

    Flash was fresh air for web, a killer application which made everybody happy. Advertisers could have now animated banners, web designers and developers could create cartoon-like websites, games were everywhere, scientists show us magic with animated visualizations, print designers could embed their best of typography into websites, and the possibilities were endless.

  <h3>The End Of Flash</h3>

    There are some success stories which come to and end. More often those who ignore the basic rules. Flash, from inception violated the first rule of the internet, the openness. It was like a black box inside the web browser: nobody knew what was inside. Even Google could not figure out what a Flash site is and penalized them in search results. Being closed source &mdash;with no community behind it's code base&mdash;the mobile revolution took on surprise Flash, and it's parent company Adobe. In 2011 the black box grew over the tiny device and even a powerful company couldn't save this wonder technology from disappearance.

    The basic unit of both web and print design.

    Books, magazines, newspapers were alive many decades or even centuries before the web. A powerful industry were creating beautiful content and the design around with well established principles, theories, professionals and a sparkling ecosystem.

    Adobe Photoshop was that tool which made the web conquer the print industry, or vice versa.

  <h3>Photoshop</h3>
  
  <p>
    Created in 1988&mdash;when Tim Berners-Lee started to work on the web&mdash;Photoshop was a basic tool for manipulating images and photographs. Everybody was using it to tell stories on paper and outdoor displays. Together with other Adobe products like Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects it was the swiss army knife of publishing, advertising and visual creativity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For these creatives the web was a strange land. It's HTML and CSS was far beyond the capabilities and expectations of those who mastered delighting the world with graphics. The web was not even a step-brother for the creative mind.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the introduction of the 'Save for Web' feature in 1998 Photoshop made a huge step making print pixels friend with web pixels, blurring the line between the two mediums, paper and monitor, and, import the waste knowledge from the publishing industry into online.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A new revolution started. Webmasters were replaced by web designers and web developers; creative people were drawing beautiful web pages in Photoshop and programmers were translating them to web. Online divisions were created in advertising agencies and publishing houses; Everybody started to think in full scale offering solutions for all platforms, including the web.

    Today Photoshop is still a force in web design&mdash;by showing a considerable decline. Again, the mobile web disrupted a technology which was not web native. With the advent of many different displays, from mobile screens to large projectors, and, the huge advancement in native web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript &mdash; designing in the browser and cutting the Photoshop intermediary step is more viable both commercially, and regarding the final result, the multi-device friendly website.

  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a huge success. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then it was translated to web by a developer and deployed to to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this magic circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Too many middlemen.

<article class="article image">
  <h3>The Old Workflow</h3>

<article class="articla text summary">
  <h3>Managing content</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enter Typo3. A so calledd Content Management System (CMS) meant to cut at least one middlemen, the sysadmin, and definitively improve the content creation process empowering the content creator, not the designer and the developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CMS was a huge step forward for the media industry. Content people could log in to an online dashboard, create articles and posts which were immediately published. The design and the associated web code were initially created by designers and developers&mdash;their further task remained to style periodically new content types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Deployment and server infrastructure was fully transparent too. In this pure environment content became reigning and many started to create content in it's own enabling the blogging revolution which lead to social networks.
