  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a success. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then translated to web by a developer and deployed to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Middlemen everywhere.

  <h3>Managing content</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enter TYPO3. A so called Content Management System (CMS) meant to cut at least one middlemen, the sysadmin, and definitively improve the content creation process empowering the content creator, not the designer and the developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CMS was a step forward for the media industry. Content people could log in to an online dashboard, create articles and posts and publish them. The page design and the associated web code were initially created by designers and developers&mdash;their further task remained to style periodically new content types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Deployment and server infrastructure was fully transparent too. In this pure environment content became reigning and people started to create content on their own enabling the blogging revolution.
