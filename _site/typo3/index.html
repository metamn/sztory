  <h3>The Content was Orphan</h3>
  
  <p>
    In ten years the web managed to conquer all visual creative industries&mdash;gaming, print, publishing, advertising&mdash;except motion picture. This was a huge success. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing left orphan was the content. The typical workflow of creating stories for the web was complicated. Somebody invented the copy, asked a designer to make it visually compelling in Photoshop, then it was translated to web by a developer and deployed to to a web server by another person, the sysadmin. Changes and updates to a website went through again this magic circle. Slow and frustrating. For everybody. Too many middlemen.

  <h3>Managing content</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enter Typo3. A so calledd Content Management System (CMS) meant to cut at least one middlemen, the sysadmin, and definitively improve the content creation process empowering the content creator, not the designer and the developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CMS was a huge step forward for the media industry. Content people could log in to an online dashboard, create articles and posts which were immediately published. The design and the associated web code were initially created by designers and developers&mdash;their further task remained to style periodically new content types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Deployment and server infrastructure was fully transparent too. In this pure environment content became reigning and many started to create content in it's own enabling the blogging revolution which lead to social networks.
