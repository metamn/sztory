        <td>3</td>
        <td>values</td>
        <td>emphasize what your site does that's valuable from the user's point of view, as well as how you differ from key competitors.</td>

        <td>4</td>
        <td>action</td>
        <td>emphasize the highest priority tasks so that users have a clear starting point for what to do next.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>entertainment</td>
        <td>if all above are not interesting for the user make it feel good by offering something fun which still connects / links back to your site.</td>
