    Unlike Eric Meyer &ldquo;The King of <abbr>CSS</abbr>&rdquo;, Jakob Nielsen a Danish researcher coined later as &ldquo;The King of Usability&rdquo; has a highly visible public so

    While other pioneers were working on the web infrastructure&mdash;the browser, structuring (<abbr>HTML</abbr>) and styling (<abbr>CSS</abbr>) content&mdash; Nielsen started to think with the readers and users mind. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the first years the World Wild Web looks funny; there were no web designers, web developers, user experience engineers but sysadmins and webmasters. With computer science background these gatekeepers of the web often came up with ... strange visual solutions.
