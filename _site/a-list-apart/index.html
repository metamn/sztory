    Founded by web designer legend Jeffrey Zeldman, The Magazine became the knowledge glue of the web. A school where every respectable web worker went to learn twice a month. If you wanted to make a name in the industry or raise a topic which changed the industry you went to A List Apart. After 16 years&mdash;infinite in web time&mdash;you still do.

  <h3>The Community</h3>
  
  <p>
    The first rule of the web, openness, implies participation and builds communities. No technology in this fast environment can survive and thrive without strong, continuous support from&mdash;not companies and organizations&mdash;but people who live, love and share unconditionally that particular technology.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A List Apart is such a classic community. Everything important related to websites flows through this channel. Topics discussed here are the pulse of the web. Problems presented here are universal and the solutions are the best of their times. From strategy, process, execution and experience to the state of the web here you can find the best answers for your questions.
