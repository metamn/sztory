  <h3>Photoshop</h3>
  
  <p>
    Created in 1988&mdash;when Tim Berners-Lee started to work on the web&mdash;Photoshop was a successful tool for manipulating images and photographs. Everybody was using it to design stories for print. Together with other Adobe products like Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects, Photoshop was the swiss army knife of publishing, advertising and visual creativity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For these creatives the web was a strange land. It's HTML and CSS was far beyond the capabilities and expectations of those who mastered delighting the world with graphics. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the introduction of the 'Save for Web' feature in 1998 Photoshop made a step forward in making print pixels friend with web pixels, blurring the line between the two mediums and import the waste knowledge from the publishing industry into online.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A new revolution started. Webmasters were replaced by web designers and web developers; creative people were drawing beautiful web pages in Photoshop and programmers were translating them to web. Online divisions were created in advertising agencies and publishing houses; Everybody started to think in full scale offering solutions for all platforms from print to web.

  <h3>Today</h3>
  
  <p>
    Today Photoshop is still a force in web design&mdash;by showing a considerable decline. Again, the mobile web disrupted a technology which was not web native. With the advent of different displays, from mobile screens to large projectors and the advancement in native web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript &mdash; designing in the browser and cutting the Photoshop intermediary step is more viable both commercially and professionally.
