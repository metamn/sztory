    Year by year it become easier to create, publish, distribute, consume and monetize content and services on the web&mdash;not just for companies but for all. The web made it's way through obstacles, learnt what's best from competition and napstered industries and minds. In ten years it became an universal platform and medium with it's own rules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The underlying standard technologies CSS and HTML evolved slower. In 25 years CSS still didn't managed to grow up three levels while HTML was already 5 and the web migrated from our desktops to our pockets and now to our watches and shoes.

  <p>
    W3C, the consortium behind web standards is the political body of the web. Members are businesses, non-profits, universities, government and individuals lead by Tim Berners-Lee the father of the web. They are working on a global consensus&mdash;like world peace&mdash;to shape the future of the web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost nobody hears about the W3C, about their progress and works. Official documents are written in a language few can decipher; periodically the most skilled professionals pick up small new pieces from these documents and present in a digestible format to the web design and development community. Which then creates patches, workarounds and force somehow these advancements to work in the latest browser editions. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The responsive, mobile web is around since 2009 where a critical task is to present different sized images on different displays for a better user experience. Today after five years the W3C still did not managed to come up with a standard way for responsive images implemented in all major browsers.

    Into this sad state of web standards and politics Dave Shea brought some enlightenment showcasing what's possible with CSS design.
