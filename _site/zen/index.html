    Year by year it become easier to create, publish, distribute, consume and monetize content and services on the web&mdash;not just for companies but for all. The web made it's way through many obstacles, learnt what's best from competion and napstered industries and minds. In ten years it became an universal platform and medium with it's own rules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The underlying standard technologies CSS (for style) and HTML (for structure) evolved&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;much slower. In 25 years CSS still didn't managed to grow up three levels while HTML5 is already mature, and meantime the web migrated from our desktops to our pockets and recently to our watches and shoes.

  <h3></h3>
  
  <p>
    W3C, the consortium behind web standards it seems to be the political body of the web. Members are businesses, non-profits, universities, government and individuals lead by Tim Berners-Lee the father of the web. They are working on a global consensus&mdash;like world peace&mdash;to shape the future of the web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost nobody hears about the W3C, about their progress and works. Official documents are written in a language few can decipher; periodically the most skilled professionals pick up small new pieces from these documents and present in a digestible format to the web design and development community. Which then creates patches, workarounds and force somehow these advancements to work in the latest browser editions. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The responsive, mobile web is around since 2009 where a critical task is to present different sized images on different displays for a better user experience. Today after five years the W3C still did not managed to come up with a standard way for responsive images.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's the sad state of web standards and politics where advancements are brought many times by huge efforts done by lonely professionals. Like Eric Meyer, and, the hero if this timeline entry, Dave Shea who tries to bring some enlightment for the web with showcasing what's currently possible with CSS design.
